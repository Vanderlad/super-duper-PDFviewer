# super-duper-PDFviewer
Custom PDF.js viewer with custom image background + optional blur effect


I often use chrome's built in pdf viewer to quickly open slides and files from my university classes. I appreciate aesthetics when spending long hours on my computer, so why not make pdf viewing a touch nicer. In the winter months I like to keep my wallpaper a nice beach background to combat seasonal affective disorder, so I thought instead of the plain gray background when viewing pdfs, I can simulate being on a beach or anywhere nice. My brain needs color haha.
